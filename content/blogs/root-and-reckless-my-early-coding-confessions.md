I was rummaging through an ancient project the other day when I stumbled upon this gem:

`﻿``
$user = 'root'; // this is bad
$password = 'password';
$database = 'projects';
`﻿``
I laughed—hard—because even back then I knew using root as your MySQL user was a recipe for disaster. I was already cluing into the fact that the all-powerful root account wasn’t something to take lightly. No StackOverflow threads to lean on, no linters nagging you about best practices—just you, your IDE, and a healthy dose of curiosity.

Looking back, it’s funny how that small comment—// this is bad—was the seed of a lifetime’s habit: questioning defaults, locking things down, and always asking “Is there a safer way?”

O﻿r maybe i was just vibe coding ))
